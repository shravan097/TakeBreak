# TakeBreak Android App Development
## My Motivation
If you are in this website then probably you can code.  I code a lot when I have ideas but I always thought,
__*"Is it good to spend time in computer a lot without resting?"*__. I came to conclusion that 
resting is an absolute necesscity in life. It is definelty __not__ a good idea to code a lot without resting. 
Resting just 15-20 minute can increase your productivity by a lot. Therefore, I am making this app that notifies you
when you should take rest. It should typically alert you every 90 minutes after you start coding.  In future,
I would also like to add some Stastic so user can view their stats.

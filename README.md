# TakeBreak Android App Development
## My Motivation
If you are in this website then probably you can code.  I code a lot too but have you ever
wondered 
__*"Is it good to spend a lot of time in computer without resting?"*__. I came to the conclusion that 
resting is an absolute necessity in life. It is definelty __not__ a good idea to code a lot without resting. 
Resting just 15-20 minute can increase your productivity significantly. Therefore, I am making this app that notifies you
to take a rest every 90 minutes or so after you start coding.  In future,
I would also like to add some Statistic so user can view their stats.
